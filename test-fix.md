# Fix for Game Over Screen Issue

## Problem
A player in a 4-player game reached the winning score, other players completed their final turns, but the game over screen didn't show up.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `checkFinalRoundProgress` function in `turn-system-integration.js`. When a player's turn ended, the function was called to mark them as completed in their final turn. However, the logic was:

```javascript
if (currentTurnPlayer === playerId) {
    console.log(`üèÜ ${playerId} is the current player - NOT marking as completed`);
    return; // Don't mark as completed if they're the current player
}
```

This caused a race condition where players were never marked as completed because at the moment their turn ended, they were still considered the "current player".

## Solution
Modified `checkFinalRoundProgress` to accept an `isTurnEnding` parameter:

1. **Updated function signature**: Added `isTurnEnding = false` parameter
2. **Updated logic**: If `isTurnEnding` is true, always mark the player as completed
3. **Updated callers**: Pass `true` when calling from turn-ending contexts (`nextTurn()` and `endMyTurn()`)

## Additional Safeguards
1. **Timeout safeguard**: Added 2-second timeout to detect stuck final rounds
2. **Force end mechanism**: `checkForStuckFinalRound()` checks if someone has winning score and forces game end
3. **Debug function**: Added `debugGameState()` for manual debugging

## Files Modified
- `/js/turn-system-integration.js`: Main fix + safeguards
- `/js/firebase-state-manager.js`: Updated call to pass `isTurnEnding: true`

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Start a 4-player game
2. Have one player reach the winning score
3. Let other players complete their final turns
4. Game should automatically end and show win modal
5. If stuck, call `debugGameState()` in console for diagnosis

## Manual Recovery
If the game gets stuck in final round:
```javascript
// In browser console:
debugGameState(); // Diagnose the issue
checkForStuckFinalRound(); // Force check and end if appropriate
```
